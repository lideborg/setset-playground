## Gap Analysis: What You're Missing

### MATCHES (You Have These)
| Stella Pose | Your Equivalent |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Front-Facing Neutral | Front |
| 3/4 Angle | 45° Angle |
| Back View | Back |
| Walking | Walking |
| Detail/Flat Lay | Detail |

### GAPS (Consider Adding)

#### 1. E-Commerce Neutral Expression
**Issue**: Your prompts emphasize "fierce gaze," "intense expression," "commanding stance"

**Stella Uses**: Calm, approachable, professional but not intimidating

**Recommendation**: Add softer expression variants to existing PDP poses
```
"...neutral approachable gaze, professional but accessible energy"
"...soft confident expression, commercial catalog presence"
"...calm direct eye contact, luxury but approachable"
```

#### 2. Accessory Display Poses
**Issue**: No poses specifically for showing bags/accessories on model

**Stella Uses**: Models actively displaying crossbody bags, shoulder bags, totes

**Recommendation**: Add new pose category
```
- Crossbody bag displayed, hand adjusting strap
- Shoulder bag carried naturally, arm engaged with handle
- Tote held at side, showing scale against body
- Clutch held at waist height, elegant hand position
```

#### 3. Subtle Walking (vs. Editorial Walk)
**Issue**: Your walking pose is editorial "striding forward with purpose"

**Stella Uses**: Gentle, natural walk emphasizing fabric movement

**Recommendation**: Add variation
```
- "Gentle mid-stride capturing natural fabric flow, easy gait"
- "Slow walk with emphasis on garment drape, controlled step"
```

#### 4. Relaxed Standing Variations
**Issue**: Current poses are quite rigid/formal

**Stella Uses**: More relaxed shoulder positioning, natural weight shift

**Recommendation**: Add to Front pose pool
```
- "Relaxed shoulders, slight natural weight shift to one hip"
- "Arms loose at sides with subtle space from body"
```
