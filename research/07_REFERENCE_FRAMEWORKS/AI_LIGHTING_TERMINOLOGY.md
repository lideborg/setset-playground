## Model-Specific Notes

### Seedance/Video

- Focus on mood rather than technical setup
- "Cinematic lighting" is particularly effective

### Image Generation (Flux, Midjourney)
- Technical terms produce more accurate results
- Can combine multiple lighting terms
- Modifier keywords (soft, hard, dramatic) are crucial
