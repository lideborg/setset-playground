## Age Categories in Fashion Modeling

### Traditional Industry Age Ranges

The fashion modeling industry has historically operated with rigid age parameters that are now evolving:

**Problematic Euphemisms:**
- "Age-defying" (implies defiance is necessary)
- "Turn back the clock" (suggests regression is desirable)
- "Ageless" (contradicts reality of aging)
- "Looks young for their age" (implies youth is superior)
- "Still beautiful" (the word "still" implies aging diminishes beauty)

### Preferred Age-Positive Terms

- "Seasoned professional" (emphasizes experience)
- "Life-lived beauty" (honors experience)

### Language Framework

- "Anti-aging skincare" → "Skin health" or "Nourishing skincare"
- "Still modeling at 50" → "Modeling at 50" or "Thriving career at 50"
- "Defying age" → "Embracing age" or "Celebrating maturity"
- "Age-appropriate" → "Personal style" or "Individual expression"

**Power Words for Age-Positive Messaging:**

## Inclusive Casting Across Ages

- Avoid tokenism (single mature model among youth)
- Cast based on suitability, not age limits
- Consider purchasing power of all ages
- Authentic representation over stereotypes
- Multigenerational storytelling opportunities

### Casting Considerations

**For Editorial:**
- What story are you telling?

- Create comfortable environment for all

**Communication:**
- Explain concepts clearly

- Be open to input from experienced models
- Create collaborative atmosphere
- Avoid age-related comments or jokes

## AI Prompting for Age Diversity

### Understanding AI Bias

**Default Bias Problem:**
- AI models default to youth when age unspecified
- Training data skewed toward young people
- Only 12% of "professional women" appear over 50 (Stable Diffusion audit 2024)
- Images of older people often less bright and less sharp
- Default outputs tend toward white, male, and young

**Training Data Limitations:**
- Limited digital images of older generations in youth
- Overrepresentation of young people in training datasets
- Quality disparity in images of older vs. younger people
- Stereotypical representations of aging reinforced

**Visual Quality Issues:**
- Older people in AI images are less bright and sharp
- More likely to show smile expressions (16% vs 6%)
- More likely to wear glasses (56% vs 12%)
- Can perpetuate stereotypes

### Explicit Age Specification

**Be Specific About Age:**
- Always specify age range when relevant
- Use numbers: "50-year-old woman," "65-year-old man"
- Use age categories: "mature woman in her 60s"
- Don't rely on default outputs

**Age Range Examples:**
- "20-year-old model"
- "35-year-old woman"
- "50-year-old man"
- "Woman in her 60s"
- "Mature model, age 55"
- "Senior model, 70 years old"
- "Elderly woman, 80+ years old"

### Positive Age Descriptors for AI

**Mature/Senior Descriptors:**
- "Mature woman with gray hair"
- "Distinguished silver-haired man"
- "Elegant woman in her 60s"
- "Confident mature model"
- "Sophisticated older woman"
- "Graceful aging beauty"
- "Silver-haired model"
- "Experienced, mature professional"

**Feature Specifications:**
- "Natural gray hair"
- "Silver hair, worn naturally"
- "Expression lines around eyes"
- "Authentic skin texture"
- "Laugh lines and wrinkles"
- "Natural aging features"
- "Unretouched appearance"

### Avoiding Stereotypes in Prompts

**Problematic Approaches:**
- "Grandmother type" (stereotypical role)
- "Old and frail" (negative framing)
- "Elderly person looking confused" (ageist stereotype)
- References to dementia or disease
- "Little old lady" (diminutive)

**Better Approaches:**
- "Confident woman in her 70s"
- "Active senior model"
- "Stylish mature woman"
- "Professional man, age 60"
- "Vibrant older person"

### Comprehensive Age-Diverse Prompts

**Structure:**
1. Age specification
2. Physical characteristics (including age-related features)
3. Emotional state/expression
4. Styling/clothing
5. Setting/environment
6. Lighting and mood
7. Photography style

**Example Prompts:**

**Mature Woman Editorial:**
"Fashion editorial photograph of a confident 58-year-old woman with natural silver hair, wearing a tailored navy blazer and white silk blouse, minimal makeup highlighting her natural beauty, warm smile with visible laugh lines, shot in natural window light, elegant studio setting, sophisticated and timeless aesthetic, professional fashion photography, 85mm lens, shallow depth of field"

**Multigenerational Fashion:**

### Technical Prompt Adjustments

**If Results Skew Too Young:**
- Increase age number: "(age 60:1.3)"
- Add: "mature appearance"
- Add: "visible signs of aging"
- Include specific features: "gray hair, wrinkles, age spots"

**If Results Skew Too Stereotypical:**
- Add: "fashionable," "contemporary styling"
- Specify: "confident," "powerful," "dynamic"
- Include: "editorial fashion photography"
- Add: "breaking age stereotypes"

**For Natural Aging Features:**
- "Unretouched natural skin"
- "Authentic aging features"
- "Minimal post-processing"
- "Natural wrinkles and texture visible"
- "Real, unfiltered appearance"

### Negative Prompts for Age Diversity

**To Avoid Youth Bias:**
- Negative: "young, youthful, teenage"
- Negative: "smooth skin, flawless skin, perfect skin"
- Negative: "filtered, heavily retouched"

**To Avoid Stereotypes:**
- Negative: "frail, weak, elderly care"
- Negative: "grandmother costume, old-fashioned clothing"
- Negative: "sad, confused, helpless"

### Model-Specific AI Considerations

**Stable Diffusion:**
- Requires explicit age specification
- Use age intensifiers: "(60 years old:1.3)"
- May need negative prompts to counter youth bias
- Test multiple seeds for best results

**Midjourney:**
- Generally better at age diversity with clear prompts
- Use "--style raw" for more realistic aging
- Specify photography style for editorial results
- May need to avoid beauty filter tendencies

**DALL-E:**
- Relatively better age representation
- Still benefits from explicit age prompts
- Handles "mature" and "senior" well
- Good at photorealistic aging

### Best Practices for Age-Diverse AI Generation

**1. Always Specify Age:**
- Never assume AI will represent age diversity without prompting
- Be explicit with numbers and age descriptors
- Include age in every relevant prompt

**2. Describe Features Positively:**
- Use celebratory language: "distinguished," "elegant," "graceful"
- Avoid negative framing: "aged," "old," "elderly" (unless appropriate)
- Emphasize confidence and style

**3. Reference Photography Styles:**
- "Editorial fashion photography"
- "Professional portrait photography"
- "High-end campaign photography"
- "Contemporary fashion shoot"

**4. Specify Minimal Retouching:**
- "Natural," "authentic," "unretouched"
- "Minimal post-processing"
- "Celebrating natural aging"

**5. Test and Iterate:**
- Generate multiple variations
- Adjust prompts based on results
- Combine successful elements
- Document what works

**6. Avoid Ageist Stereotypes:**
- Don't limit older people to grandparent roles
- Avoid medical or care settings (unless specifically needed)
- Show activity, fashion, confidence
- Present mature people in contemporary settings
