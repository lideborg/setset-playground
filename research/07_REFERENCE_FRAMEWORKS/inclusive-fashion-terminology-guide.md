## Core Principles

### 1. Individual Preference is Paramount
Always ask individuals how they identify and use their preferred terminology. When individual preference is unavailable, follow the guidelines in this document.

### 2. Be Specific, Not Vague
- Use specific country, culture, or heritage descriptors rather than broad generalizations
- Example: "Korean American model" rather than "Asian model"
- Example: "Nigerian-British model" rather than "African model"

### 3. Necessity Test
Ask yourself: Is identifying ethnicity, race, or cultural background actually necessary for this description? If not, omit it entirely.

### 4. Avoid Othering Language
Don't use terms that imply "default" (white/Western) versus "other" (non-white/non-Western). Every identity is equally valid.

### 5. Context Matters
Understand the difference between:
- **Race**: Physical characteristics that separate individuals into groups
- **Ethnicity**: Culturally determined identity that may not be physically reflected
- **Heritage**: Cultural, ancestral, or national origin
- **Nationality**: Country of citizenship

### 6. Evolving Language
Language preferences evolve. Stay current with community preferences and be willing to update your vocabulary.

---

## Current Best Practices

### Capitalization (AP Style 2024)
- **Capitalize**: Black, Indigenous, Asian, Hispanic, Latino, Latina, White (when referring to race/ethnicity)
- Use capitalization to recognize shared identity, history, and culture beyond physical characteristics

### Hyphenation
- **NO hyphens** in dual-heritage terms: African American, Asian American, Native American, Latin American
- Previously hyphenated terms (African-American) are now written without hyphens per AP Style updates

### Framing
- Use people-first language: "Black people," "Asian models," "Hispanic designers"
- **Avoid** using racial/ethnic terms as plural nouns: "Blacks," "Asians," "Hispanics"
- Exception: When referencing specific communities who prefer noun form

### Inclusivity in Open Casting
When a role could be played by anyone of any background:
- Explicitly state: "Open to models of all racial/ethnic backgrounds"
- List specific groups: "We welcome Black, Indigenous, Asian, Hispanic, Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern, multiracial, and white models"
- Don't assume "diversity" is understood—be explicit

---

## Regional & Ethnic Terminology

### Black / African American
**Current Guidance (2024):**
- Both terms are acceptable but NOT interchangeable
- **Black** is broader and more inclusive (includes people of African descent from various national origins)
- **African American** refers specifically to Black Americans with ancestry from enslaved Africans in the United States
- **Capitalize** both terms when referring to race/ethnicity

**When to Use Each:**
- **Black**: For broad references, international contexts, or when heritage is from Caribbean, African countries, or Latin America
- **African American**: For U.S.-specific contexts when referring to descendants of enslaved Africans in America
- **Be specific**: When possible, use "Haitian American," "Nigerian British," "Ethiopian," "Jamaican Canadian," etc.

**Community Preferences:**
- 50-67% of community members have no strong preference between the two
- Among those with preferences, views are split evenly
- Always defer to individual preference when known

### Hispanic / Latino / Latina / Latinx / Latine
**Current Guidance (2024):**

**Community Preferences (Pew Research 2023-2024):**
- 68% prefer **Hispanic**
- 21% prefer **Latino** or **Latina**
- Only 2-4% self-identify as **Latinx**
- 40% find "Latinx" bothersome or offensive
- 75% of those aware of "Latinx" say it should NOT be used

**Recommendations:**
- **First choice**: Use specific heritage—Mexican American, Cuban, Guatemalan, Salvadoran, Colombian, etc.
- **Gender-specific**: Latino (masculine), Latina (feminine)
- **Gender-neutral**:
  - Hispanic (most widely accepted)
  - Latino/Latina (traditional)
  - Latine (emerging gender-neutral alternative, more widely accepted than Latinx)
  - Latinx (use only if specifically requested or when referring to LGBTQ+ contexts where it's preferred)

**For Casting:**
- Ask for specific heritage when possible
- If using umbrella terms, "Hispanic" and "Latino/Latina" are safest
- Avoid "Latinx" unless specifically requested by talent or client

### Asian / Asian American
**Current Guidance:**

**Be Specific—Asia is NOT Monolithic:**
- **East Asian**: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Taiwanese
- **Southeast Asian**: Filipino, Vietnamese, Thai, Cambodian, Indonesian, Malaysian, Singaporean, Burmese, Laotian
- **South Asian**: Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Nepali, Sri Lankan, Bhutanese, Afghan
- **Central Asian**: Kazakh, Uzbek, Turkmen, Tajik, Kyrgyz

**Best Practices:**
- Use country-specific terms: "Korean American," "Filipino model," "Indian British"
- **Avoid**: Using "Asian" when you specifically mean East Asian—this erases South and Southeast Asian experiences
- When heritage is unknown or mixed, "Asian American" or "Asian" is acceptable
- In the U.S., many perceive "Asian" as synonymous with East Asian—actively work against this by being specific

**Terminology Notes:**
- Pacific Islander is a distinct category (NOT the same as Asian)
- AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islander) acknowledges both groups but can obscure differences
- Some South Asians feel excluded by blanket "Asian" terminology

### Middle Eastern / North African (MENA)
**Current Guidance (2024):**

**Major Update:**
- U.S. Census now recognizes "Middle Eastern or North African" (MENA) as a distinct racial/ethnic category (as of 2024)
- Previously, MENA individuals were classified as "white," erasing 5+ million Americans' unique backgrounds

**Geographic Coverage:**
- **Middle East**: Arab countries in Western Asia (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, etc.), Iran, Turkey, Israel/Palestine
- **North Africa**: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Sudan

**Best Practices:**
- Use specific country/heritage: "Lebanese American," "Egyptian," "Iranian British," "Moroccan"
- When umbrella term is needed: "Middle Eastern," "North African," or "MENA"
- **Avoid**: "Arab" when you mean the broader MENA region (not all MENA people are Arab—e.g., Iranians, Israelis, Turks)
- Recognize religious diversity: MENA includes Muslims, Christians, Jews, Druze, and other faiths

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Acknowledge ongoing MENA Heritage Month (March)
- Be mindful of political sensitivities (Palestine/Israel, etc.)
- Credit specific cultures when featuring traditional dress or design elements

### Indigenous / Native American / First Nations
**Current Guidance:**

**Terminology Varies by Region:**
- **United States**: Native American, American Indian, Indigenous, Alaska Native
- **Canada**: First Nations, Inuit, Métis, Indigenous
- **Australia**: Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, First Nations, Indigenous
- **New Zealand**: Māori, Indigenous
- **Latin America**: Indigenous, Indígena

**Best Practices:**
- **Always prioritize** tribal/nation specificity: "Navajo," "Cree," "Seminole," "Hopi," "Lakota"
- Use "Indigenous" (capitalized) when referring to original inhabitants
- In U.S. contexts: Both "Native American" and "American Indian" are acceptable—preferences vary by individual
- **Never** use "Indian" alone (too ambiguous—Indian from India vs. American Indian)

**Critical Considerations:**
- Indigenous fashion/art is frequently appropriated—credit and compensate Indigenous artists
- Sacred items (headdresses, ceremonial dress) should NEVER be used as fashion unless created by and with permission from the community
- Legal protections exist: U.S. Indian Arts and Crafts Act requires designers be enrolled in recognized tribes
- Support Indigenous Fashion Week events and Indigenous-owned brands

### Pacific Islander
**Current Guidance:**

**Geographic Coverage:**
- **Polynesia**: Hawaiian, Samoan, Tongan, Tahitian, Māori
- **Micronesia**: Chamorro (Guam), Marshallese, Palauan
- **Melanesia**: Fijian, Papua New Guinean, Solomon Islander

**Best Practices:**
- Pacific Islander is distinct from Asian (don't conflate)
- Be specific: "Samoan American," "Native Hawaiian," "Tongan"
- NHPI = Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander
- Acknowledge cultural significance of traditional dress and tattoos

### Multiracial / Biracial
**Current Guidance:**

**Acceptable Terms:**
- **Multiracial**: Two or more racial backgrounds
- **Biracial**: Two racial backgrounds specifically
- **Multiethnic**, **Polyethnic**: Multiple ethnic backgrounds

**Terms to AVOID:**
- "Mixed" or "mixed-race" (can carry negative connotations—use only if individual prefers)
- "Half" (as in "half-Black")—implies incompleteness
- "Mulatto" (outdated, offensive)

**Best Practices:**
- Be specific about heritage: "Black and Korean American," "Filipino and Mexican," "Nigerian and Irish"
- Ask how individuals identify—many multiracial people identify strongly with one heritage
- Don't assume someone's background based on appearance
- Recognize that multiracial identity is complex and personal

---

## Physical Features & Characteristics

### General Principles
- **Avoid** describing physical features unless absolutely necessary for the creative brief
- **Never** use value judgments or hierarchical language
- Focus on characteristics relevant to styling, fit, or creative vision—not stereotypes
- Recognize that physical features vary enormously within any ethnic group

### Features to Emphasize (When Relevant)
**For Styling/Fit Purposes:**
- Height ranges
- Body proportions relevant to garment fit
- Hair length/volume for styling decisions
- Features relevant to accessory sizing (e.g., eyewear, hats)

**For Creative Vision:**
- Specific aesthetic you're seeking (but describe the aesthetic, not stereotyped features)
- Reference images showing desired overall look
- Styling direction (minimalist, bold, classic, avant-garde)

### Features to AVOID Specifying
**These Perpetuate Stereotypes:**
- Specific eye shapes associated with ethnicity
- Nose shapes/sizes
- Lip fullness
- Bone structure generalizations
- Any feature that fetishizes or exoticizes

### Respectful Approach
Instead of specifying ethnic features, describe the aesthetic or mood:
- ❌ "Asian model with almond eyes"
- ✅ "East Asian model with strong editorial presence"

- ❌ "Black model with full lips"
- ✅ "Black model with classic features"

- ❌ "Exotic-looking Middle Eastern model"
- ✅ "Lebanese model with contemporary style"

### Colorism Awareness
Be conscious of colorism (discrimination based on skin tone within racial/ethnic groups):
- Don't consistently favor lighter-skinned models within ethnic groups
- Represent the full spectrum of skin tones within each community
- Avoid terminology that values lighter skin ("fair," "light," "golden") over darker skin

---

## Hair Texture & Styling

### Hair Typing System
**Type 1**: Straight
**Type 2**: Wavy
**Type 3**: Curly
**Type 4**: Coily/Kinky (ranging from tight coils to Z-angled coils)

### Respectful Terminology

**Natural Hair:**
- Afro-textured hair that has not undergone chemical processes to alter texture
- Recognize that natural hair is professional and elegant
- Counter harmful stereotypes about "appropriate" hair

**Protective Styles:**
- **Locs** (preferred) NOT "dreadlocks" (has negative connotations suggesting hair is frightening)
  - Formed through twisting, braiding, or palm rolling
  - Cultural significance in Black, Rastafarian, and other communities

- **Braids:**
  - **Box Braids**: Sectioned into squares or boxes, then plaited
  - **Cornrows**: Braids that lay flat to the scalp, typically in rows
  - **Bantu Knots**: Small, coiled buns
  - **Senegalese Twists**: Two-strand twists

- **Weaves & Extensions**: Added hair for length, volume, or protection

**Hair Texture Descriptors:**
- Coily, kinky, curly, wavy, straight
- Tight coils, loose coils, defined curls, waves
- Fine, medium, coarse (referring to strand thickness)
- Low, medium, high density (referring to hair quantity)

### Terms to AVOID
- "Nappy" (offensive, derogatory)
- "Good hair" vs. "bad hair" (perpetuates colorism and texture discrimination)
- "Wild," "unruly," "untamed" (implies natural texture is problematic)
- "Dreadlocks" (use "locs" instead)

### Cultural Appreciation vs. Appropriation
**When featuring braids, locs, or culturally significant styles:**
- Credit the specific cultural origin
- Hire hairstylists from the community
- Use models from the community when featuring their traditional styles
- Compensate Black hairstylists and models appropriately
- Don't present these styles as "trends" when they're cultural traditions

**Red Flags:**
- White models wearing traditionally Black hairstyles (cornrows, box braids) without cultural context
- Renaming traditional styles (e.g., "boxer braids" instead of "cornrows")
- Presenting cultural styles as edgy/urban/trendy without acknowledging their origin

---

## Skin Tone Description

### General Principles
- Describe skin tones respectfully and accurately
- Avoid language that perpetuates colorism or suggests one tone is superior
- Be mindful that skin tone exists on a spectrum with infinite variations
- Consider both overtones (surface color) and undertones (warm, cool, neutral)

### Respectful Descriptive Language

**Technical/Professional Terms:**
- Light, medium light, medium, medium deep, deep, very deep
- Fair, tan, brown, dark brown, deep brown
- Warm undertones, cool undertones, neutral undertones
- Rich, luminous, radiant (when describing quality/appearance)

**When Necessary to Be More Specific:**
- Porcelain, ivory, beige, olive, bronze, mahogany, ebony
- Golden, amber, caramel, chocolate, espresso (use sparingly)
- Reference photography/makeup shade scales: "MAC NC40," "Fenty 290"

### Metaphorical Language—Use Carefully
**Generally Acceptable:**
- Golden hues of sunset
- Rich earth tones
- Morning coffee shades
- Natural light references

**Generally AVOID:**
- Food comparisons for darker skin tones (can be seen as fetishizing or objectifying)
- Outdated terms: "red bone," "yellow bone," "high yellow" (offensive)
- "Exotic" in any context

### Photography & Editing Considerations
**For Photographers:**
- Learn to correctly expose and color grade diverse skin tones
- Skin presents in innumerable tones, shades, hues, and saturations
- Honor the true color of each subject's skin
- Avoid over-lightening or over-darkening in post-production
- Test lighting setups with models of various skin tones

**For Casting Calls:**
- When skin tone range is relevant for lighting/styling tests: "Seeking models across all skin tones from very light to very deep"
- Avoid unnecessary skin tone specifications

### Fighting Colorism
**In casting and representation:**
- Feature the full spectrum of skin tones within each ethnic group
- Don't consistently favor lighter skin tones
- Recognize colorism exists across all communities (Black, Latino, Asian, Indigenous, etc.)
- Challenge beauty standards that prioritize lighter skin

---

## Terms to AVOID

### Offensive/Outdated Racial Terms
**NEVER USE:**
- Any racial slurs (this should be obvious)
- "Mulatto" (outdated, offensive)
- "Colored" or "colored people" (outdated—exception: NAACP uses "colored" in historical name)
- "Oriental" (offensive when referring to people; outdated for objects/rugs/food)
- "Red bone," "yellow bone," "high yellow" (offensive colorism terms)
- Terms implying racial purity or fractions ("half-breed," "full-blooded")

### Othering/Generalizing Terms
**AVOID:**
- **"Ethnic"** when you mean non-white
  - ❌ "Ethnic model"
  - ✅ "Nigerian model" or "South Asian model"

- **"Exotic"** when describing people
  - Implies foreignness and otherness
  - Fetishizes non-white features
  - ❌ "Exotic beauty"
  - ✅ "Striking features" or specific heritage

- **"Tribal"** for prints/patterns
  - Overgeneralizes diverse African cultures
  - Implies primitive/uncivilized
  - ❌ "Tribal print"
  - ✅ "Inspired by Kente cloth" or "West African geometric patterns"

- **"Urban"** as code for Black
  - Often used as euphemism
  - ✅ Be direct and specific instead

- **"Diverse"** to mean non-white
  - Diversity includes everyone, including white people
  - ❌ "Diverse model" (implies non-white default)
  - ✅ "Models from diverse backgrounds" or be specific

### Problematic Umbrella Terms
**Use with Caution or Avoid:**
- **"People of Color" (POC)**: Acceptable for broad references, but avoid for individuals; don't abbreviate to "POC"
- **"BIPOC"** (Black, Indigenous, People of Color): Avoid—can flatten distinct experiences
- **"Minority"**: Increasingly avoided; alternatives include "underrepresented groups" or specific communities
- **"Visible minority"**: Outdated; preference is "racialized person/group" in some regions (Canada)
- **"Non-white"**: Defines people by what they're not; use specific identities instead

### Fashion-Specific Problematic Terms
**AVOID:**
- **"Primitive"**: Implies uncivilized, backward
- **"Peasant"**: Demeaning class associations
- **"Folk"**: Patronizing, diminishing
- **"Regional"** (when implying lesser-than)
- **"Traditional"** (unless accurately describing historical garments)
- **"Non-Western"**: Defines by what it's not; be specific instead

**Better Alternatives:**
- Name the specific culture: "Inspired by Japanese kimono design"
- Use "global," "international," "multicultural" for multiple cultures
- "Heritage-inspired," "culturally significant designs"

### Physical Description Terms to Avoid
**NEVER:**
- "Almond eyes" (stereotypes Asian features)
- Any descriptions that fetishize or exoticize
- Food metaphors that objectify (especially for darker skin tones)
- "Wild," "savage," "untamed" (racist connotations)

---

## Intersectionality Considerations

### What is Intersectionality?
The interconnected nature of social categorizations (race, gender, class, sexuality, disability, age) creating overlapping systems of discrimination or privilege.

### Why It Matters in Fashion
- A Black trans woman faces different experiences than a white trans woman or a Black cis woman
- A disabled Asian model encounters unique challenges at the intersection of disability and race
- Representation must acknowledge these layered identities

### 2025 Fashion Industry Statistics
- 46% of models cast were models of color
- 19% were plus-size or mid-size
- 7% were disabled or had visible differences
- But intersectional representation (e.g., plus-size models of color) remains limited

### Best Practices for Intersectional Representation

**Race + Gender:**
- Don't assume gender based on appearance
- Use inclusive language: models, people, individuals
- Recognize specific challenges (e.g., Black trans models, Asian non-binary models)

**Race + Disability:**
- Disabled models of color are severely underrepresented
- Adaptive fashion must serve all ethnic communities
- Don't tokenize—disabled models of color shouldn't be novelties
- Example pioneers: Aaron Philip (Black transgender model with cerebral palsy)

**Race + Size:**
- Plus-size representation is often predominantly white
- Actively cast plus-size models of color
- Recognize different beauty standards across cultures regarding body size

**Race + Age:**
- Older models of color are underrepresented
- Don't default to young models for diversity casting
- Represent aging across all ethnic groups

**Race + Socioeconomic Class:**
- Recognize barriers to entry in fashion (education, networking, location)
- Fashion industry access is not equal for all qualified candidates
- 50% of employees of color report career advancement barriers
- Support programs that uplift minority-owned brands and create pathways

**Race + Religion:**
- Muslim models who wear hijab
- Jewish models observing Shabbat
- Sikh models wearing turbans
- Accommodate religious practices in scheduling and styling

### Intersectional Casting Language
**Examples:**
- "Seeking Black plus-size models for inclusive athleisure campaign"
- "Open to disabled models of all ethnic backgrounds"
- "Casting Asian American models age 40+ for luxury skincare"
- "Looking for hijab-wearing models, all ethnic backgrounds welcome"

### Avoiding Tokenism
**Don't:**
- Cast one person to check multiple diversity boxes
- Use intersectional identities as gimmicks
- Feature intersectional models only in "diversity" campaigns

**Do:**
- Represent intersectional identities across all campaigns
- Compensate fairly regardless of identity
- Create inclusive working environments
- Support career advancement for intersectional talent

## Evolution of Terminology: What's Changed

### Outdated → Current

| OUTDATED (Don't Use) | CURRENT (Use Instead) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Oriental | Asian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, or specific country |
| Colored | Black, African American, person of color (for groups) |
| Mulatto | Biracial, multiracial, or specific heritages |

## Quick Reference: Red Flags

### Immediate Red Flags to NEVER Do
1. Using racial slurs (obviously)
2. Using "exotic" to describe people
3. Using "tribal" or "ethnic" to mean non-white
4. Using "Oriental" for people
5. Featuring sacred Indigenous items (headdresses) as fashion
6. Whitewashing (casting white models in roles clearly meant for people of color)
7. Cultural appropriation without credit/compensation
8. Renaming cultural styles to erase their origin (e.g., "boxer braids" for cornrows)
9. Using food metaphors to objectify darker skin
10. Assuming someone's ethnicity based on appearance

### Approach with Extreme Caution
1. Describing physical features based on racial stereotypes
2. Using "urban" as code for Black
3. Casting one person to represent all diversity
4. Featuring models of color only in "diversity" campaigns
5. Using "diverse" to mean "non-white"
6. Assuming gender based on appearance
7. Over-lightening or over-darkening skin in editing
8. Creating ethnic-themed shoots without cultural consultation
9. Claiming colorblindness ("I don't see race")
10. Using outdated terminology just because "that's how it's always been"
