## 1. Hair Classification Systems

### 1.1 Andre Walker Hair Typing System

The most widely recognized hair classification system, created by Oprah Winfrey's stylist Andre Walker in the 1990s. Uses an alphanumeric system ranging from 1A to 4C.

#### **Type 1: Straight Hair**
- **1A**: Perfectly straight, fine, with no wave pattern. Tends to be oily and shiny.
- **1B**: Straight with slight body and volume. Medium texture.
- **1C**: Straight hair with a coarser texture. May have slight bends or waves at the ends.

**Characteristics**: No curve, lies flat against the scalp, reflects light easily, prone to oil distribution from scalp.

#### **Type 2: Wavy Hair**
- **2A**: Fine, thin S-shaped waves. Easy to style straight or wavy.
- **2B**: Medium-textured S-shaped waves with more defined pattern. Some frizz.
- **2C**: Thick, coarse S-shaped waves. Prone to frizz and requires moisture.

**Characteristics**: S-shaped pattern, ranging from subtle to bouncy waves, volume at the crown, may appear curly when damp.

#### **Type 3: Curly Hair**
- **3A**: Loose, S-shaped spirals about the size of sidewalk chalk. Fine to medium texture. Shiny with defined curls.
- **3B**: Springy ringlets about the circumference of a Sharpie marker. Medium to coarse texture. Needs moisture to maintain spiral shape.
- **3C**: Tight curls or corkscrew pattern. Dense, thick texture. Prone to frizz and requires significant moisture.

**Characteristics**: Visible curls ranging from loose to tight, natural volume, prone to frizz, requires moisture, may have varying curl patterns on one head.

#### **Type 4: Coily/Kinky Hair**
- **4A**: Densely packed S-pattern coils about the size of crochet needles. Retains moisture better than 4B/4C. Distinct curl pattern.
- **4B**: Bends in sharp, zigzag patterns rather than coiling. Less defined curl pattern. Very fragile, requires gentle handling.
- **4C**: Tightly coiled or completely zigzag pattern with minimal definition. Shrinkage up to 75%. Most fragile and driest hair type.

**Characteristics**: Tightly coiled or zigzag patterns, very dense, naturally dry (scalp oils cannot easily travel down the hair shaft), most fragile and damage-prone, highly versatile for styling, significant shrinkage when wet.

### 1.2 LOIS Hair Classification System

Created by OurHair.net, eliminates numerical labels and focuses on visual pattern identification. More intuitive for natural hair textures.

#### **Pattern Types:**

- **L (Bend)**: Hair has all bends, right angles, and folds with little to no curve. Angular, sharp turns in the strand.

- **O (Curl)**: Hair is rolled up into the shape of one or several zeros, like a spiral. Circular pattern.

- **I (Straight)**: Hair lies mostly flat with no distinctive curve or bend. Linear pattern.

- **S (Wave)**: Hair looks like a wavy line with hills and valleys. Wave pattern.

**Note**: Hair can have a combination of L, O, I, S letters, possibly with one dominant pattern.

#### **Additional LOIS Components:**

**Strand Size:**
- **Fine**: Thinner than sewing thread
- **Medium**: Equal in size to thread
- **Thick/Coarse**: Thicker than thread

**Texture Types (based on sheen and porosity):**
- **Thready**: Low sheen, high shine when held taut, low frizz. Wets easily but dries quickly.
- **Wiry**: Sparkly sheen, low shine, low frizz. Water beads up or bounces off strands.
- **Silky**: Low sheen, very high shine, variable frizz. Easily wets in water.
- **Cottony**: Low sheen, low shine, high frizz. Does not readily absorb water.
- **Spongy**: Medium sheen, low shine, minimal frizz. Absorbs water quickly like a sponge.

### 12.11 Avoiding Common Prompt Pitfalls

**Be Specific About**:
- Exact curl pattern type (don't just say "curly" - specify 3A, 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B, or 4C)
- Color level AND undertone (not just "blonde" but "level 8 light blonde with golden undertones")
- Length in both inches and visual landmark (not just "long" but "waist-length, approximately 28 inches")
- Texture and density together ("fine texture with medium density" vs. "coarse texture with high density")

**Avoid Contradictions**:
- Don't combine incompatible elements: "type 4C hair with loose beachy waves" (4C doesn't naturally form loose waves)
- Be realistic: "bone straight hair with spiral curls" is contradictory
- Consider shrinkage: Type 4 hair descriptions should account for natural shrinkage

**Cultural Sensitivity**:
- Use proper names: "box braids" not "boxer braids"
- Use "locs" instead of "dreadlocks"
- Give cultural context when appropriate: "Fulani braids with traditional bead placement"
