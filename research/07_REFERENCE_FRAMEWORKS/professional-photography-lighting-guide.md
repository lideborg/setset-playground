## Studio Lighting Setup Fundamentals

### Three-Point Lighting System
The foundational studio lighting setup consisting of three primary light sources positioned strategically around the subject.

#### **Key Light**
- **Definition**: The primary and most powerful light source in any lighting setup
- **Purpose**: Defines the subject's form, dimension, and overall mood
- **Typical Position**: 45-degree angle from the subject, slightly above eye level
- **Characteristics**: Brightest light source, creates the main shadows and highlights
- **AI Prompt Terms**: "key light at 45 degrees", "primary light source", "main lighting"

#### **Fill Light**
- **Definition**: Secondary light used to reduce shadows created by the key light
- **Purpose**: Brings out details in shadow areas without eliminating them completely
- **Typical Position**: Opposite side of the subject from key light, closer to camera
- **Characteristics**: Softer and less bright than key light (typically half the intensity)
- **AI Prompt Terms**: "fill light", "shadow detail", "balanced lighting"

#### **Back Light / Rim Light / Hair Light**
- **Definition**: Light positioned behind the subject
- **Purpose**: Creates separation from background, adds depth and dimension
- **Typical Position**: Behind subject, angled to avoid lens flare
- **Characteristics**: Creates a glowing outline or rim around subject's edges
- **AI Prompt Terms**: "rim lighting", "backlit", "edge lighting", "hair light", "separation light"

### Additional Studio Lights

#### **Background Light**
- **Definition**: Dedicated light for illuminating the backdrop
- **Purpose**: Creates separation, adds interest, or achieves specific background tones
- **Typical Position**: Aimed at background, away from subject
- **AI Prompt Terms**: "illuminated background", "gradient background lighting"

#### **Kicker Light**
- **Definition**: Accent light similar to rim light but typically lower and from the side
- **Purpose**: Adds highlights to specific areas, creates drama
- **Typical Position**: Low angle, 45-90 degrees to the side of subject
- **AI Prompt Terms**: "kicker light", "side accent lighting", "dramatic edge lighting"

## Color Temperature and White Balance

### Understanding the Kelvin Scale

**Color Temperature**: The color characteristics of light measured in degrees Kelvin (K).

**Key Principle**:
- Lower Kelvin numbers (2000-3500K) = Warmer, more orange/yellow light
- Higher Kelvin numbers (5000-10000K+) = Cooler, more blue light

**Counterintuitive Note**: Blue light is technically "hotter" in temperature but appears "cool" visually; orange light is "cooler" in temperature but appears "warm" visually.

### Common Color Temperature Values

#### **1000-2000K - Candlelight**
- Characteristics: Very warm, deep orange-red
- Mood: Intimate, romantic, cozy
- AI Prompt Terms: "candlelight", "warm firelight", "1800K warm glow"

- Characteristics: Very blue, cool
- Common Sources: Clear blue sky, blue hour
- Mood: Cool, atmospheric, dramatic
- AI Prompt Terms: "blue hour", "cool twilight", "deep blue lighting"

### White Balance in Photography

**Definition**: Camera setting that determines which color temperature appears as neutral white.

#### **Purpose**:
Ensures accurate color reproduction by compensating for different light sources.

#### **Common White Balance Presets**:
- **Auto (AWB)**: Camera determines color temperature automatically
- **Daylight (5500K)**: For midday sun
- **Shade (7000K)**: Compensates for blue cast in shade

- **Tungsten (3200K)**: For indoor tungsten lights
- **Fluorescent (4000K)**: For fluorescent lighting
- **Flash (5500K)**: For flash photography
- **Custom**: User sets specific Kelvin value

#### **Creative White Balance**:
- **Warmer than actual**: Creates cooler, more blue image (increasing K setting)
- **Cooler than actual**: Creates warmer, more orange image (decreasing K setting)
- **Intentional Mismatch**: Used for creative color effects in fashion editorial

### Mixing Color Temperatures

#### **Creative Applications**:
- Warm key light with cool fill light
- Warm interior with cool window light
- Multiple colored gels at different temperatures

#### **AI Prompting**:
