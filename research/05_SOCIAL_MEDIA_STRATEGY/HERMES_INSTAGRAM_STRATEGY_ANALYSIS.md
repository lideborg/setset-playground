## 1. CAROUSEL STRUCTURE & IMAGE COUNT

### Industry Standard (2024-2025)
- Instagram now supports **up to 20 slides per carousel** (updated August 2024)
- Previous limit was 10 slides
- **Optimal engagement**: 7-10 slides per carousel

### Best Practices for Luxury Brands
- **First slide is critical**: Must be compelling enough to drive swipes AND shareable for Stories
- **Hook on slides 1 AND 2**: Double-hook strategy increases engagement significantly
- Lead with strongest visual to create memorable brand narrative
- Sequential visual storytelling where each slide builds on the previous

### Hermès Specific Approach
While exact carousel counts weren't documented, Hermès is known for:
- **Bite-sized content** that can be easily consumed
- **Vignette structure** - longer projects broken into Instagram-friendly clips
- Focus on **single elements** (particular bag, design step, manufacturing process) through fresh visual perspectives

### Recommended Sequence Pattern (Based on Luxury Best Practices)

**TIMEX Luxury Product Model**:
1. **Hero shot** - Clean, polished image showcasing elegance/craftsmanship
2. **Detailed close-ups** - Material and construction breakdowns
3. **Feature highlights** - Specific features in action
4. **Product core** - Intricate mechanics/craftsmanship reinforcement
5-7. **Additional angles/details** as needed
8-10. **Lifestyle context or artistic interpretation**

**Nike Product Reveal Strategy**:
1. Teaser image (creates anticipation)
2. Product from various angles
3. Detail shots highlighting features
4. Call-to-action slide

**Problem-Solution Arc**:
1. Aspiration/desire ("Perfect Morning Ritual")
2. Features ("handcrafted, ethically sourced")
3. Proof (close-up, lifestyle shot)
4. Invitation to explore

## 2. GRID AESTHETIC & POSTING PATTERNS

### The 3-Post Grid Strategy (Sets of 3)

**Chanel's Approach** - Industry Leader:
- Uses **photo splitting** across 3 consecutive posts
- Adds matching text to split images making them standalone AND cohesive
- Example: "G-A-B-R-I-E-L-L-E" spelled across 7 posts
- Advantage: **Never messes layout** when posting other content

**Classic 3x3 Grid Layout**:
- Most widely recognized format
- Creates balanced, symmetrical appearance
- Each square occupies equal space for harmonious flow
- Simple, clean, professional look

### Row-by-Row Strategy
- **Each row shares theme, story, or color palette**
- Creates "mini collections of three" as users scroll
- Three consecutive images that belong together tell a story

### Repeating Patterns
- Repeat specific post type every 3, 6, or 9 posts
- Example: Every 3rd post is product shot, creating visual rhythm
- Strengthens brand recognition through predictable structure

### Hermès Grid Philosophy
- **No typical lookbook portraits** or standard product shots
- Majority of feed: **"color and craft"** - playful illustrations, virtual sculptures
- Commissioned works from artists with strong social media presence
- **Seasonless approach** - doesn't tie posts to launches or events
- Posts enrich ongoing narrative of artistry rather than following fashion cycles
