## 4. AI Ethics and Diversity Storytelling in Fashion

### The Critical Context for 2024-2025

AI in fashion faces intense scrutiny around:
- **Authenticity vs. simulation** of diversity
- **Job displacement** concerns for models and photographers
- **Algorithmic bias** perpetuating existing beauty standards
- **Transparency** requirements for AI-generated content
- **Data sources** and consent for training imagery
- **"Diversity washing"** using AI without genuine commitment

### Key Debates and Your Position

#### **The Diversity Paradox**

**The Criticism:**
- "Using AI to advocate for diversity is counterproductive" — Rebecca Valentine, Grey Modeling Agency
- "AI does not celebrate diversity but parodies it"
- Concern that AI allows "appearance of diversity without having to invest in it"
- Brands profiting from simulated people of color without supporting actual models

**Your Ethical Positioning Options:**

**Position A: AI as Supplement, Not Replacement**
```
"We don't believe AI models should replace human models—they serve different
purposes. Real models bring lived experience, authenticity, and emotional
resonance that AI cannot replicate. Our tool is designed for ideation, concept
development, and situations where photoshoots aren't feasible—not as a
substitute for investing in diverse talent."
```

**Position B: Democratization for Small Players**
```
"Emerging designers and small brands often can't afford professional
photoshoots at all—meaning they have zero representation, not limited
representation. Our tool gives them the ability to visualize their designs on
diverse body types and skin tones, which is better than the alternative of
only creating content with whatever models they can personally access."
```

**Position C: Transparency and Training Data Ethics**
```
"The key to ethical AI fashion tools is transparency about training data and
algorithmic choices. We've intentionally [describe your approach: curated
diverse training data, partnered with photographers, compensated image sources,
etc.] and we clearly label all AI-generated content. This isn't about replacing
humans—it's about expanding creative possibilities responsibly."
```

#### **Algorithmic Bias**

**The Problem:**
- Most generative tools trained on data reflecting existing biases
- AI often reproduces narrow, Eurocentric beauty ideals
- Image-generation platforms exacerbate race and gender biases

**Your Ethical Response:**

**Training Data Strategy:**
```
"We recognized early that AI models reflect their training data. Unlike
general-purpose image generators, we've specifically:
• Curated training data to include [X]% diverse representation across
  [specific dimensions: ethnicity, body type, age, ability, etc.]
• Partnered with [photographers/agencies] to license diverse imagery
• Implemented algorithmic checks to prevent bias in output
• Regular auditing of generated images for representation balance
• Transparency reports showing diversity metrics of outputs"
```

**Active Anti-Bias Measures:**
```
Key commitments:
1. Diverse training data curation (not just scraped web images)
2. Regular bias audits and public reporting
3. User controls for representation specifications
4. Partnerships with diversity advocates and consultants
5. Continuous model improvement based on community feedback
```

#### **Job Displacement Concerns**

**The Anxiety:**
- Professional models losing work to AI
- Photographers replaced by algorithms
- Creative professionals made obsolete

**Your Responsible Positioning:**

**Augmentation, Not Replacement Narrative:**
```
"Fashion has evolved through many technological shifts—from film to digital,
from print to online. Each created anxiety about job losses, but actually
expanded opportunities. AI is another tool in the creative toolkit, most
powerful when used by skilled professionals who understand fashion,
composition, and storytelling.

Our users are:
• Photographers who use it for mood boarding and client presentations
• Creative directors who prototype concepts before expensive shoots
• Students learning fashion photography principles
• Brands who previously had no photo content at all

We're not replacing professional fashion photography—we're making ideation
and concept development more accessible."
```

**New Opportunities Created:**
```
AI creates new roles:
• AI prompt engineers who understand fashion language
• Digital creative directors
• AI tool consultants for brands
• Training data curators and diversity consultants
• AI ethics officers for fashion companies
```

#### **Transparency and Disclosure**

**Current State:**
- No global regulations requiring AI disclosure in fashion imagery
- US Vogue's Guess campaign faced backlash for tiny-type AI disclosure
- Best practice: clear, prominent labeling

**Your Transparency Commitment:**

**Public Disclosure Policy:**
```
Our Transparency Standards:
1. All imagery generated by our tool includes metadata indicating AI origin
2. We provide watermark/badge options for social media posts
3. Our terms of service require users to disclose AI-generated content
4. We publish annual transparency reports on:
   - Training data sources and licensing
   - Diversity metrics of outputs
   - Bias audit results
   - User feedback and improvements
5. We advocate for industry-wide disclosure standards
```

**Sample Disclosure Language:**
```
Social Media: "Image created with [Your Tool Name] AI"
Editorial: "Photography concepts generated using AI assistance"
E-commerce: "Product shown on AI-generated model"
Portfolio: "AI-assisted creative direction"
```

- Highlighting wide-spanning representation of fashion, culture, identity
- Combating lack of diverse representation in AI-generated fashion content

```
"No single company can solve these challenges alone. We advocate for:
• Industry-wide disclosure requirements
• Shared bias mitigation best practices
• Compensation standards for training data
• Regulatory frameworks for AI in fashion
• Ongoing dialogue with affected communities"
```

### Key Quotes for Media (Ethics Theme)

by our tool includes clear disclosure, and we publish regular transparency
reports. If the industry is going to embrace AI, it must be with honesty
and accountability."
— [Founder Name], Founder & CEO
```

**On Human Creativity:**

technology and talented humans who understand culture, emotion, and
storytelling."

```

**On Industry Responsibility:**
```

the harder path—intentional, transparent, accountable development—because
fashion's future depends on it."

- **Earn media** because personal stories are compelling

Lead with "Why" rather than "What" or "How."

**Act 2: The Journey (The "How")**
- What obstacles did you face building this?
- What did you learn about the problem and solution?
- Who helped you along the way?
- What surprised you in the process?

**Act 3: The Vision (The "What Next")**

- How will the industry change?
- What's your broader mission beyond the product?
- What's next for you and the company?

### Founder Archetypes for Fashion Tech

Choose the narrative that best fits your authentic story:

#### **Archetype 1: The Fashion Insider Turned Technologist**

**Profile:**
- Background in fashion (designer, photographer, stylist, editor)
- Experienced industry limitations firsthand
- Learned tech to solve personal frustrations
- Brings credibility in fashion world

**Story Template:**
```
"I spent [X] years as a [fashion role] working with [types of clients/projects].
I kept hitting the same wall: [specific problem]. Traditional solutions
meant [expensive/limiting/exclusive options]. After spending $[X] on yet
another photoshoot that [frustration], I decided to learn Python. I had
no idea if it would work, but I knew there had to be a better way.

[X] months later, I had a rough prototype. I shared it with my fashion
network, expecting polite interest. Instead, I got [enthusiastic response].
Turns out, everyone felt this pain but assumed it was just 'how things are done.'

That's when I realized this wasn't just a tool for me—it could change how
the entire industry creates content. Now we're working with [types of users]
to make [vision for industry]."
```

**Key Messages:**
- Industry credibility and insider knowledge
- Personal frustration leading to innovation
- Understanding of real fashion workflows
- Mission to help community, not just build product

**Media Appeal:** Fashion publications love "one of us" stories

---

#### **Archetype 2: The Tech Expert Who Discovered Fashion**

**Profile:**
- Background in AI/ML/tech (engineering, research, product)
- Initially saw fashion as interesting technical challenge
- Fell in love with the creative community and possibilities
- Brings technical sophistication and innovation

**Story Template:**
```
"I came from [tech background], working on [previous work]. When I first
explored applying AI to fashion imagery, I thought it was just an interesting
technical problem—complex enough to be challenging, visual enough to be
satisfying.

But as I spent time with photographers, designers, and creative directors,
I realized I'd stumbled into something much more important. The creative
community was being underserved by generic tools that didn't understand
their specific needs. [Specific realization moment].

I've spent my career building AI systems, but this is the first time I've
been part of a creative community. Fashion isn't just about pretty pictures—
it's about expression, identity, culture, and art. Building tools for this
industry requires technical excellence AND deep respect for creative vision.
That's what we're building."
```

**Key Messages:**
- Technical credibility and innovation
- Respect for fashion as creative discipline
- Cross-disciplinary perspective
- Commitment to serving creative needs, not just tech showcase

**Media Appeal:** Tech publications love "tech meets culture" stories

---

#### **Archetype 3: The Democratizer / Accessibility Champion**

**Profile:**
- Background as outsider to fashion establishment
- Frustrated by barriers to entry (cost, access, connections)
- Mission-driven about accessibility and equity
- Passionate about empowering underrepresented voices

**Story Template:**
```
"I'm not from the fashion world. I didn't go to [prestigious school], I
didn't have connections at [major publications], and I definitely didn't
have the budget for professional photoshoots. But I had ideas, vision, and
a deep frustration with how the industry gatekeeps access to tools and
platforms.

I watched talented designers and creatives give up because they couldn't
afford to produce the imagery needed to compete. I saw brands default to
the same aesthetic because that's what was accessible. I realized the
problem wasn't lack of creativity—it was lack of access to professional
tools.

[Your tool] started as my answer to that gatekeeping. If I couldn't afford
to hire [expensive resources], I'd build technology that gave me the same
capabilities. Now we're giving that access to [types of users], and watching
creativity flourish when barriers are removed."
```

**Key Messages:**
- Accessibility and democratization mission
- Challenging establishment and gatekeeping
- Empowering underrepresented voices
- Diversity of perspectives and aesthetics

**Media Appeal:** Culture and business publications love "disrupting gatekeepers" stories

---

#### **Archetype 4: The Sustainability Pioneer**

**Profile:**
- Environmental consciousness as core motivation
- Frustrated by fashion industry's waste and impact
- Sees technology as solution to sustainability challenges
- Mission to reduce industry's environmental footprint

**Story Template:**
```
"I love fashion, but I couldn't ignore the waste. Every photoshoot I saw
meant [travel, sample production, set construction, etc.]. I started
calculating the carbon footprint of a single editorial spread: [specific
data]. Multiply that by thousands of shoots annually, and fashion's content
creation alone has a massive environmental impact.

I wondered: what if we could achieve the same creative output with a
fraction of the resources? Not as a compromise, but as an innovation—
better creativity with less waste. That question led to [your tool].

We're not anti-photoshoot. We're pro-efficiency. Use photoshoots for what
they're uniquely good at—capturing real emotion, real fabric, real moments.
Use AI for ideation, iteration, and content that doesn't require physical
production. The industry can have both creativity and sustainability."
```

**Key Messages:**
- Environmental responsibility as core value
- Technology as solution to sustainability challenges
- Industry impact and systemic change
- Balance between creativity and responsibility

**Media Appeal:** Sustainability-focused media and conscious consumer publications

---

#### **Archetype 5: The Hybrid / Renaissance Professional**

**Profile:**
- Background spanning multiple relevant fields
- Brings unique perspective from diverse experiences
- Connects dots others don't see
- Thrives at intersections and boundaries

**Story Template:**
```
"I've had an unusual path: I've been a [role 1], a [role 2], and a [role 3].
People kept asking me to pick a lane. But I realized my superpower was
seeing connections between worlds that don't usually talk to each other.

When I [specific experience combining fields], I saw an opportunity that
pure fashion people or pure tech people might miss: [unique insight].
[Your tool] exists because I refused to choose between [domain 1] and
[domain 2]. It required [specific combination of expertise].

The future doesn't belong to specialists in isolation—it belongs to people
who can bridge disciplines and build at the intersections. That's where
innovation lives."
```

**Key Messages:**
- Cross-disciplinary innovation
- Unique perspective from diverse background
- Bridging traditional silos
- Future-focused thinking

**Media Appeal:** Innovation and future-focused media

**Process:**
1. Research specific editor/reporter who covers your topic
2. Find their recent articles and mention in your pitch
3. Offer exclusive first coverage with embargo
4. Provide comprehensive package (interview, assets, data)

**Example Mix:**
- 1 fashion publication (different angle than Phase 1)

- Weekends = don't pitch unless breaking news

**Time of Day:**
- **9-11am** in journalist's timezone
- Early enough to plan their day
- Not too early (before coffee)
- Avoid lunch hours and end of day

**Time of Year:**
- **Avoid:** Major holidays, Fashion Week (unless directly relevant), August (vacation month), December holidays
- **Best:** January (new year, new trends), September (post-summer), March-April, October
- **Consider:** Publication schedules (monthly vs. daily)

**News Cycle Awareness:**
- Check if major news is breaking in your space
- Your pitch will get buried in major news cycles
- Wait for quieter news days when possible

---

### Following Up Without Being Annoying

#### **The Follow-Up Sequence:**

**Day 1:** Initial pitch sent (Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am)

**Day 4-5:** First follow-up if no response
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [Name],

Following up on my pitch from [day]. I know you're busy, so I wanted to
resurface this in case it got buried.

[One sentence reminding them of the pitch]

Happy to send additional information or adjust timing if you're interested
but busy right now. Also completely fine if it's not a fit!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

**Day 9-10:** Final follow-up
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [Name],

Last follow-up on this—I know it's not always the right fit or timing.
If you're not interested in this story, I'd love to know what kinds of
pitches DO interest you so I can be more relevant in the future.

Either way, I appreciate your time.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Then:** Move on. Don't follow up more than twice unless they've indicated interest.

---

#### **Response Handling:**

**If they respond with interest:**
- Respond within hours
- Provide everything they need immediately
- Be available for their timeline (journalists work fast)
- Over-deliver on promises

**If they respond "not right now":**
- Thank them for responding
- Ask when might be better timing
- Ask what angles interest them
- Stay in touch without pestering

**If they respond "not interested":**
- Thank them graciously
- Ask what kinds of stories they prefer
- Don't burn bridges
- Keep them on your list for future relevant pitches

**If they never respond:**
- Don't take it personally (journalists get 100+ pitches/day)
- Keep them on your list for future pitches
- Try different angles or timing later
- Focus on journalists who do respond

---

### Building Long-Term Relationships

#### **Think Beyond the Immediate Pitch:**

**1. Be a Resource**

**3. Respect Their Craft**
- Don't tell them how to write the story
- Trust their editorial judgment
- Accept when they can't cover something
- Understand their constraints and pressures

**4. Stay in Touch (Not Just When You Want Something)**
- Congratulate them on great articles
- Share interesting industry news
- Comment on their social media thoughtfully
- Build genuine relationship, not transactional

**5. Make Their Job Easy**
- Provide high-quality assets ready to use
- Be available when they need you
- Hit deadlines or be early

**Format Options:**

**Option 1: Product Announcement**
```

```
Example: "Setset Launches AI Platform That Generates Editorial Fashion Photography Prompts"

#### **Subheadline (120-150 characters)**

Expands on headline with additional key benefit or detail.

**Examples:**
```
"New platform reduces fashion content production costs by 70% while expanding
diversity and creative possibilities"

"AI tool trained on editorial fashion photography brings professional-quality
prompt generation to designers and creatives"

"Technology enables emerging designers to create brand imagery previously
requiring five-figure budgets"
```

---

#### **Dateline**

```
CITY, STATE, Month Day, Year —
```
Example: "NEW YORK, January 15, 2025 —"

---

#### **Opening Paragraph (The "Lede")**

**Must answer: Who, What, When, Where, Why**

**Template:**
```
[Company Name], a [company description], today announced the launch of
[Product Name], a [product category] that [key benefit]. Available
[availability details], [Product Name] enables [target audience] to
[specific capability] for [context/comparison to previous options].
```

**Example:**
```
Setset, a fashion technology startup, today announced the launch of its
AI-powered prompt generation platform that creates editorial-quality fashion
photography briefs in seconds. Available now to designers, photographers,
and brands, Setset enables fashion creatives to generate professional
photography direction without the traditional requirement of extensive
industry experience or five-figure production budgets.
```

---

#### **Problem Paragraph**

Establish the problem or market gap your product addresses.

**Template:**
```
[Industry] faces significant challenges with [specific problem]. Currently,
[target audience] must [existing difficult process], which results in
[negative outcomes]. According to [source], [compelling statistic about
the problem]. This creates particular barriers for [most affected group].
```

**Example:**
```
The fashion industry spends over $50 billion annually on content production,
yet emerging designers and small brands often cannot afford professional
photography services. A single editorial photoshoot typically costs $15,000-
$50,000, requiring photographers, models, stylists, locations, and post-
production. According to the Business of Fashion, 67% of emerging designers
cite "lack of professional imagery" as a primary barrier to retail
partnerships and press coverage.
```

---

#### **Solution Paragraph**

Describe your product and how it solves the problem.

**Template:**
```
[Product Name] addresses these challenges by [approach/technology]. The
platform [describe functionality] enabling [target users] to [specific
capabilities]. Key features include:

• [Feature 1 with brief benefit]
• [Feature 2 with brief benefit]
• [Feature 3 with brief benefit]
• [Feature 4 with brief benefit]
• [Feature 5 with brief benefit]

Unlike [alternative approaches], [Product Name] [key differentiation].
```

**Example:**
```
Setset addresses these challenges by combining advanced AI language models
with deep fashion industry knowledge. The platform translates user inputs
into comprehensive photography prompts that include lighting specifications,
styling direction, mood references, and technical parameters. Key features
include:

• Fashion-specific terminology trained on 50,000+ editorial photoshoots
• Style customization from high fashion to streetwear aesthetics
• Diversity specifications for inclusive model representation
• Export formats compatible with major AI image generators
• Collaboration tools for creative teams

Unlike generic AI image generators, Setset understands fashion industry
language and editorial standards, producing prompts that reflect professional
creative direction.
```

#### **Founder Quote**

Personal perspective on why this matters.

**Template:**
```
"[Quotation explaining personal motivation, product vision, or industry
impact. Should sound natural and conversational, not corporate. Include
specific detail or insight that humanizes the technology.]"

— [Founder Name], [Title] of [Company]
```

**Example:**
```
"I spent a decade as a fashion photographer watching talented designers
struggle to afford the imagery needed to build their brands. After spending
$50,000 on a single editorial shoot, I realized this model was fundamentally
broken. Setset democratizes access to professional creative direction—
the kind of expertise that previously required years of industry experience
or expensive consultants. Fashion's next generation of creativity shouldn't
be limited by budget."

— Sarah Chen, Founder and CEO of Setset
```

---

#### **Customer/Industry Quote (Optional but Recommended)**

Third-party validation from user, partner, or industry expert.

**Template:**
```
"[Quotation from customer explaining how they use the product, specific
benefits they've experienced, or what it enables them to do. Include
concrete detail.]"

— [Name], [Title] at [Company/Brand]
```

**Example:**
```
"Setset transformed how we create brand content. As an emerging sustainable
fashion brand, we couldn't afford traditional photoshoots for every collection.
Now we can generate dozens of creative concepts, test different aesthetics,
and present professional briefs to photographers when we do invest in shoots.
It's become essential to our creative process."

— Maya Rodriguez, Creative Director at Verde Studio
```

```

**Example:**
```
Setset is available now with three pricing tiers: a free version for
individual creators (10 prompts/month), Pro ($29/month, unlimited prompts
with advanced features), and Enterprise (custom pricing for brands and
agencies with team collaboration and API access). The platform works with

### Press Release Best Practices

#### **Writing Style:**

**DO:**
- Use active voice ("Company launches" not "Product was launched")
- Write in third person (no "we" or "our")
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences)
- Front-load important information
- Use specific data and metrics
- Include relevant keywords for SEO
- Make quotes sound like humans, not robots
- Proofread multiple times

**DON'T:**
- Use excessive jargon or buzzwords
- Make unsubstantiated claims ("revolutionary," "industry-leading")
- Include fluff or unnecessary adjectives
- Bury the news in later paragraphs
- Make it overly promotional
- Include humor that might not land
- Use quotes that sound like corporate speak

---

#### **Length:**

**Ideal:** 400-600 words (one page when printed)

**Absolute maximum:** 800 words

If you can't make your point in 600 words, your messaging isn't clear enough.

---

#### **Visual Assets:**

Always include with press releases:

1. **Hero Image**
   - Product screenshot or key visual
   - High-resolution (300 DPI, at least 2000px wide)
   - Proper attribution/credit

2. **Founder Headshot**
   - Professional quality
   - High-resolution
   - Multiple options (serious, smiling, etc.)

3. **Logo**
   - Full color and black versions
   - Vector format (SVG, EPS) if possible
   - PNG with transparent background

4. **Sample Outputs**
   - 5-10 example images showcasing product
   - Variety of styles and use cases
   - High-resolution

5. **Demo Video** (Optional but Recommended)
   - 60-90 seconds
   - Product demonstration
   - Hosted on YouTube/Vimeo with embed link

---

### Distribution Strategy

#### **Newswire Services:**

| Service | Cost | Reach | Best For |
|---------|------|-------|----------|
| **PR Newswire** | $350-2,000+ | Comprehensive, trusted by journalists | Major announcements, funding, broad reach |
| **Business Wire** | $400-2,000+ | Business/finance focus | B2B, financial news, investor audience |
| **GlobeNewswire** | $250-1,500+ | International reach | Global companies, cost-effective |
| **PRWeb** | $99-389 | SEO and online focus | Small budgets, online visibility |
| **Newswire** | $149-749 | Affordable option | Startups, limited budgets |

**Decision factors:**
- Budget available
- Target audience (consumer vs. B2B vs. investors)

### Timing Your Press Release

#### **Embargo Strategy:**

**What is an embargo:**
Sharing news with journalists before public announcement, with agreement not to publish until specified date/time.

**When to use:**
- Major news requiring journalist research/interviews
- Wanting coordinated coverage across multiple outlets
- Giving journalists time to write quality pieces

**Embargo format:**
```
EMBARGOED UNTIL [DAY, DATE] AT [TIME] [TIMEZONE]

Example: EMBARGOED UNTIL TUESDAY, JANUARY 15 AT 6:00 AM EST
```

**Embargo best practices:**
- Give journalists 3-7 days advance notice
- Choose Tuesday-Thursday 6am EST for release (catches morning news cycles)
- Clearly mark "EMBARGOED" at top of release
- Send reminder day before embargo lifts
- Be available for interviews during embargo period

---

#### **Launch Day Coordination:**

**Timeline example for Tuesday launch:**

**Week Before:**
- Send embargoed release to Tier 1 target journalists
- Confirm interviews scheduled
- Prepare all assets and materials

**Monday (day before):**
- Send embargo reminder to journalists
- Final check all assets available
- Prepare social media posts
- Notify team, investors, advisors

**Tuesday, 6:00am EST (launch):**
- Press release goes live on newswire
- Personal emails to all journalists
- Post to website news section
- Social media announcements

**Tuesday, 9:00am-5:00pm:**
- Monitor coverage and respond to journalist questions
- Engage with social media response

## 8. Building Relationships with Fashion Tech Journalists

### The Relationship-First Approach

**Key Principle:**
> Journalists are not megaphones for your message. They're professionals serving their audience. Build genuine relationships, not transactional interactions.

**Long-term thinking:**
- You'll launch multiple products
- You'll have ongoing news to share
- Journalists move between publications
- Reputation matters in small communities
- Today's rejection may be tomorrow's feature

---

### Phase 1: Research and Mapping

#### **Identify Your Core 20 Journalists**

These are the 20 journalists who:
- Cover your specific intersection (fashion + tech, AI + creativity, etc.)
- Write for publications your audience reads
- Have demonstrated interest in similar stories
- Are accessible (not just top-tier editors-in-chief)

**Your Core 20 should include:**
- 5 from fashion publications
- 5 from tech publications
- 5 from business/industry publications
- 5 from design/creative publications

---

#### **Deep Research on Each:**

Create a profile including:

**Professional:**
- Current publication and role
- Previous publications/roles
- Beat/focus areas
- Recent articles (last 3 months)
- Podcast appearances or speaking engagements
- Books authored

**Topics of Interest:**
- Recurring themes in their coverage
- Unique angles they take
- Companies/people they cover repeatedly
- Trends they're tracking

**Communication Preferences:**
- Do they share pitch preferences publicly?
- Email, Twitter DM, or LinkedIn preferred?
- Response patterns (fast/slow, detailed/brief)

**Personal:**
- Social media personality and interests
- Side projects or passions
- Industry advocacy or causes

---

### Phase 2: Strategic Following and Engagement

#### **Become a Familiar Name (Before You Pitch)**

**Month 1-2: Following Phase**

**On Twitter:**
- Follow your Core 20
- Turn on notifications for their tweets
- Read their shared articles
- Don't engage yet, just observe

**On LinkedIn:**
- Send connection request with brief, friendly note:
  ```
  "Hi [Name], I've been following your coverage of [topic] and really
  appreciated your recent piece on [specific article]. I'm working at
  the intersection of [your space] and would love to be connected."
  ```
- Don't pitch in the connection request
- Engage with their posts (likes first, then thoughtful comments)

**Newsletter Subscription:**
- Subscribe to their newsletters
- Actually read them
- Take notes on their interests and themes

---

**Month 2-3: Engagement Phase**

**On Twitter:**
- Like tweets that resonate
- Retweet with brief (not promotional) comment
- Reply to questions they pose to community
- Share their articles with your network (tag them)

**Example good engagement:**
```
"Great analysis by @journalist on [topic]. The point about [specific insight]
is especially relevant as [trend/observation]. Would add that [thoughtful
addition, not self-promotional]."
```

**On LinkedIn:**
- Comment on their posts with substantive responses
- Share their articles
- Congratulate them on great pieces

**Via Email:**
- Reply to their newsletters with specific feedback
  ```

  resonated. I've seen similar trends in [related observation]. Thanks
  for the great coverage."
  ```
- Keep it brief, genuine, non-promotional
- No asks, just appreciation

---

**Month 3-4: Value-Add Phase**

**Provide Value Before Asking for Anything:**

**Share Relevant Information:**
```
"Hi [Name], I know you cover [topic]. Just saw this report from [source]
on [relevant data] and thought you might find it interesting for a future
piece. No agenda here, just seemed relevant to your beat!"
```

**Make Introductions:**
```
"Hi [Name], I saw you're working on a story about [topic]. I know
[Expert Name] at [Company] who has deep expertise here. Would you find
an intro helpful? No pressure if not relevant."
```

**Answer Their Questions:**
When journalists post asking for sources, information, or perspectives:
```
"@journalist I may be able to help with [your question]. I've worked in
[relevant area] and would be happy to share perspective. DM if useful!"
```

**Provide Data or Research:**
```
"Hi [Name], following your recent article on [topic], I pulled together
some data on [related topic] that might be interesting for future coverage.
No strings attached, just thought it might be useful context."
```

---

### Phase 3: The Relationship Pitch

especially loved your piece on [specific article] and the point you made

## 9. Case Studies of Successful Fashion Tech PR Campaigns

### Case Study 1: Lalaland.ai - AI Diversity Positioning

**Company:** Lalaland.ai (Dutch company)
**Product:** AI-generated fashion models for e-commerce
**Launch:** 2023-2024

#### **The Challenge:**
- Entering controversial space (AI models potentially replacing real models)
- Concerns about "diversity washing" using AI
- Skepticism from fashion industry about authenticity

#### **The Strategy:**

**1. Ethics-First Positioning**
- Trained algorithm on actual photos of people from underrepresented communities
- Created licensing model to compensate those communities
- Built "strong database on hair, skin, and body types of different ethnicities"
- Created revenue stream to help underrepresented communities

**2. Industry Partnership Approach**
- Partnered with fashion brands (including Levi's testing program)
- Positioned as solution for brands already committed to diversity
- Focused on body type and skin tone diversity in marketing

**3. Media Strategy**
- Secured coverage in Fortune, Yahoo Finance, Fashion ABC
- Positioned founder as expert on AI ethics in fashion
- Welcomed critical dialogue rather than avoiding it

#### **The Results:**
- Major brand partnerships (Levi's, others)
- Coverage in business and fashion press
- Positioned as "responsible" AI in controversial space
- Sparked industry conversation (even critical coverage raised awareness)

#### **Key Lessons:**

### Key Takeaways

**1. Relationships Before Pitches**
Build genuine relationships with journalists over months, not days. Provide value before asking for coverage.

**2. Story Matters More Than Product**
Connect to bigger narratives: democratization, ethics, sustainability, innovation. Make technology human and relatable.

**3. Ethics and Transparency Are Non-Negotiable**
Address AI ethics head-on. Be transparent about training data, limitations, and industry challenges. Lead the conversation.

**4. Visual Excellence Is Required**
Fashion industry demands beautiful visuals. Your product screenshots, sample outputs, and press kit must meet high aesthetic standards.

**5. Authenticity Beats Polish**
In 2024-2025, authentic founder stories and imperfect humanity resonate more than corporate perfection. Tell real stories.

**6. Personalization Scales**
Customize pitches for each journalist and publication. No mass emails. Reference their work specifically.

**7. Multi-Channel Integration**
Combine press outreach, influencer partnerships, social media, events, and content marketing. No single channel is enough.

**8. Patience and Persistence**
PR is long-term. You're building brand recognition and relationships that compound over years, not viral hits.

**9. Make Journalists' Jobs Easy**
Provide ready-to-use assets, respond quickly, meet deadlines, and package information clearly. Remove friction.

**10. Ethics and Impact Above All**
In fashion tech AI, how you approach diversity, representation, and human impact matters as much as your technology.

### Final Thoughts

Fashion tech PR sits at the intersection of multiple worlds: technology innovation, creative expression, business transformation, and cultural impact. Success requires fluency in all these languages.

Your tool exists at a unique moment: AI is transitioning from experimental to mainstream in fashion, diversity and ethics are paramount concerns, and the industry is hungry for solutions that balance innovation with responsibility.

The media landscape is ready for your story—but only if you tell it with authenticity, visual excellence, ethical awareness, and deep respect for both fashion's creative culture and journalism's professional standards.

Build relationships first. Lead with values. Show, don't just tell. Be patient but persistent. And remember: the goal isn't just coverage—it's building a brand that matters to the future of fashion.
