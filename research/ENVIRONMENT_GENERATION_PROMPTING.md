# Environment Generation: Prompting Guide for Editorial Fashion Photography

## Reve Model Best Practices

### Core Principles
Reve Image 1.0 excels at understanding **natural language** - describe what you want as you would to another person. The model treats lighting, tone, environment, and camera angle as physical attributes.

**Key formula:**
`[Environment] + [Detailed Description] + [Atmospheric Conditions] + [Lighting] + [Technical Details] + [Style]`

### What Makes Reve Different
- Superior prompt adherence (follows long, detailed prompts)
- Exceptional photorealistic textures and natural imperfections
- Understands lighting direction and quality deeply
- Responds well to professional photography terminology

### Essential Prompting Techniques

**1. Be Specific About Materials & Textures:**
- NOT: "brick wall"
- BETTER: "weathered red brick wall with visible mortar, aged patina, and paint chips"

**2. Include Atmospheric Conditions:**
- "morning mist filtering through", "post-storm golden hour light"
- "fog creating soft diffused light", "rain-slicked surfaces reflecting"

**3. Specify Light Quality:**
- Direction: "warm side light", "backlighting", "soft light from the left"
- Quality: "harsh shadows", "soft diffused", "dappled through leaves"
- Time: "golden hour", "blue hour", "overcast midday"

**4. Add Professional Photography Terms:**
- "shot on Arri Alexa", "35mm film aesthetic"
- "shallow depth of field", "bokeh background"
- "high-end fashion magazine style", "editorial quality"

**5. Layer Your Composition:**
- Always describe foreground, midground, background elements
- Include scale indicators and compositional elements
