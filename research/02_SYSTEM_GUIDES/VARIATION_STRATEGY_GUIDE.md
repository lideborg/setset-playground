# Systematic Variation Strategy for Editorial Prompts

**Based on Setset's variation methodology applied to manual template system**

---

## The Problem

Current prompts have:
- ✅ Great environmental diversity (20 different locations)
- ✅ Great clothing color diversity (20 different combinations)
- ❌ **Too much similarity in everything else** (same poses, same shot approach, same energy)

**Result:** 20 prompts that feel too uniform despite location changes

---

## The Solution: Multi-Dimensional Variation

Instead of varying ONLY environment and clothing, we **systematically vary 6 dimensions** across the 20 prompts:

### 6 Variation Dimensions

1. **Environment** (already doing well)
2. **Lighting Setup** (need more variety)
3. **Shot Type & Framing** (need more variety)
4. **Pose & Energy** (need more variety)
5. **Camera Specs** (need more variety)
6. **Mood & Expression** (need more variety)

## 20-Prompt Structure Blueprint

### STUDIO SECTION (Prompts 1-4)

**Purpose:** Controlled studio environment with lighting variation

| # | Lighting Type | Pose | Shot | Lens | Energy |
|---|--------------|------|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Hard directional key light | Hands on hips | Full body | 50mm f/8 | Powerful |
| 2 | Rembrandt lighting | One hand in pocket | Full body | 50mm f/8 | Confident |
| 3 | Side lighting | Head shot chest-up | Tight crop | 85mm f/5.6 | Intense |
| 4 | Rim backlight + fill | Adjusting hair | Full body | 50mm f/8 | Elegant |

**Variation Focus:** Lighting technique diversity while keeping environment constant

---

### ENVIRONMENTAL SECTION (Prompts 5-20)

Divide into **5 lighting/mood categories** with different approaches:

---

#### Category A: BRIGHT EPIC (Prompts 5-8)
**Lighting:** Bright, harsh, midday sun
**Aperture:** f/16 (deep depth of field)
**Lens:** 35mm (wide, show environment)
**Sky Formula:** "huge sky 80 percent sky"
**Energy:** Powerful, expansive

| # | Environment | Pose | Special Note |
|---|------------|------|--------------|
| 5 | Museum interior | Standing centered | Even bright lighting |
| 6 | Salt flats | Walking | Harsh overhead sun |
| 7 | Canyon overlook | Standing | Bright definition |
| 8 | Quarry | Standing | Harsh dramatic light |

**Why this works:** All share epic scale but vary in pose (standing vs walking) and environment type

---

#### Category B: GOLDEN/WARM (Prompts 9-11)
**Lighting:** Golden hour, twilight, warm glow
**Aperture:** f/11
**Lens:** 35mm
**Color:** Saturated warm tones, sunset tones
**Energy:** Dramatic, atmospheric

| # | Environment | Pose | Special Note |
|---|------------|------|--------------|
| 9 | Observatory platform | Standing | Twilight soft light |
| 10 | Heath landscape | Standing | Golden hour glow |
| 11 | Utility space/room | Standing | Golden hour interior |

**Why this works:** Consistent warm lighting mood, varied environments (outdoor vs architectural)

---

#### Category C: SOFT/DIFFUSED (Prompts 12-15)
**Lighting:** Soft, overcast, diffused natural light
**Aperture:** f/11
**Lens:** 35mm
**Color:** Natural, serene tones
**Energy:** Calm, contemplative

| # | Environment | Pose | Special Note |
|---|------------|------|--------------|
| 12 | Bamboo forest | Standing | Soft diffused through trees |
| 13 | Foggy field | Standing | Soft natural diffused |
| 14 | Observation deck | Standing | Soft natural light |
| 15 | Zen garden | Standing | Soft overcast even |

**Why this works:** Consistent soft mood, nature-focused environments

---

#### Category D: ARCHITECTURAL/GEOMETRIC (Prompts 16-18)
**Lighting:** Varies (dramatic to even)
**Aperture:** f/11 or f/16
**Lens:** 35mm
**Focus:** Clean lines, minimal geometry
**Energy:** Strong, architectural

| # | Environment | Pose | Lighting |
|---|------------|------|----------|
| 16 | Pavilion/walls | Standing | Hard side light creating shadows |
| 17 | Amphitheater | Walking | Harsh dramatic light |
| 18 | Lighthouse interior | Standing | Soft window light geometric |

**Why this works:** Architectural consistency with lighting variety

---

#### Category E: LUXURY/UNIQUE (Prompts 19-20)
**Lighting:** Special/unique setups
**Purpose:** Standout editorial moments
**Energy:** Varies

| # | Environment | Pose | Special Note |
|---|------------|------|--------------|
| 19 | Infinity pool edge | Standing | Bright overhead + ocean horizon |
| 20 | Conservatory glass | Standing | Soft through glass + botanical |

**Why this works:** Premium locations that feel special/memorable

## Advanced Variation Techniques

### 1. Pose Variation Within Minimal Style

Instead of ONLY "standing hands on hips," use this expanded library:

**Standing Poses (Hands):**
- Hands on hips (powerful)
- One hand in pocket (confident casual)
- Adjusting hair (elegant gesture)
- Arms at sides (neutral strong)
- One hand touching face/chin (contemplative)
- Arms crossed (strong editorial)

**Walking Poses:**
- Walking salt flats (purposeful motion)
- Walking amphitheater steps (architectural motion)

**Seated/Alternate:**
- Could add: Standing hand on hip + weight shifted
- Could add: Standing one leg crossed in front

**Key:** Vary the HANDS and WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION within standing

---

### 2. Camera Spec Variation Strategy

**From Setset guide - match lens to shot type:**

| Shot Type | Lens | Aperture | Use When |
|-----------|------|----------|----------|
| Epic landscape | 35mm | f/16 | Huge sky, complete scene sharp |
| Standard environmental | 35mm | f/11 | Balance environment + subject |
| Standard studio | 50mm | f/8 | Studio portraits, controlled |
| Headshot/tight | 85mm | f/5.6 | Chest-up, background soft |

**Apply this across 20 prompts:**
- Prompts 1-2, 4: 50mm f/8 (studio standard)
- Prompt 3: 85mm f/5.6 (headshot)
- Prompts 5-8: 35mm f/16 (bright epic)
- Prompts 9-20: 35mm f/11 (environmental balance)

---

### 3. Lighting Variation Matrix

**Studio Lighting (Prompts 1-4):**
1. Hard directional key light from above
2. Rembrandt lighting (creates triangle under eye)
3. Dramatic side lighting
4. Rim backlight + soft fill

**Environmental Lighting (Prompts 5-20):**
- Bright even museum lighting
- Harsh overhead sunlight
- Golden hour warm glow
- Soft diffused through trees/clouds
- Twilight soft natural
- Dramatic hard side light
- Soft window light geometric
- Bright overhead + reflection

**Pattern:** Never repeat same lighting setup twice

---

### 4. Expression/Gaze Variation

Instead of always "direct confident gaze intense forward selling," vary:

- Direct confident gaze intense forward selling (powerful)
- Intense confident gaze engaging powerful selling (engaging)
- Confident powerful gaze forward selling presence (presence)
- Direct powerful gaze forward confident selling (assured)
- Powerful confident gaze penetrating direct selling (penetrating)
- Confident intense gaze forward selling (focused)

**Subtle variations in word order create different energy**

---

### 5. Color Grading Variation

**Match color grading to lighting category:**

**Bright Epic:**
- saturated white-blue color grading vibrant natural high contrast
- high contrast color grading saturated earth tones
- saturated gray-blue vibrant dramatic high contrast

**Golden/Warm:**
- high contrast color grading saturated sunset tones
- saturated warm color grading high contrast

**Soft/Diffused:**
- saturated green-gold tones high contrast vibrant natural
- saturated cool gray tones high contrast vibrant natural
- saturated cool color grading high contrast earthy tones

**Architectural:**
- high contrast architectural color grading saturated whites
- saturated architectural color grading vibrant

## Implementation: Creating Diverse Prompts

### Old Approach (Too Similar):
```
All 20: "standing" + different environment + same everything else
Result: Feels repetitive
```

### New Approach (Systematic Variation):
```
Prompts 1-4: Studio + 4 different lighting setups
Prompts 5-8: Bright epic + f/16 + varied poses
Prompts 9-11: Golden hour + warm tones + varied environments
Prompts 12-15: Soft diffused + nature + calm energy
Prompts 16-18: Architectural + geometric + dramatic light variety
Prompts 19-20: Luxury unique moments
```

**Result:** True diversity across multiple dimensions

```
Prompt 5: Museum, standing, bright light
Prompt 6: Forest, standing, soft light
Prompt 7: Salt flats, standing, harsh light
Prompt 8: Observatory, standing, twilight
```
**Problem:** All just "standing" with different places

### AFTER (Systematic Variation)
```
Prompt 5: Museum, standing centered, bright even, f/11, powerful
Prompt 6: Forest, standing, soft diffused, f/11, calm
Prompt 7: Salt flats, walking, harsh overhead, f/16, powerful motion
Prompt 8: Observatory, standing, twilight soft, f/11, dramatic
```
**Improvement:** Varied poses (standing centered, standing, walking), varied energy (powerful, calm, motion, dramatic), varied apertures (f/11, f/16)

## Key Insight from Setset

From their guide (lines 1030-1109):

> "Environmental context variations naturally suggest different poses"

**Apply this:**
- Salt flats → walking (wind, movement, vastness)
- Forest → standing calm (zen, stillness)
- Amphitheater → walking steps (architectural motion)
- Pool edge → standing (contemplative)
- Observatory → standing (observing, looking out)

**Let the environment suggest the pose and energy**
