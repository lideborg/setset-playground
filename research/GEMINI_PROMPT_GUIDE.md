# Gemini Image Generation Prompt Guide

> Source: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation#prompt-guide

## Core Principle

**"Describe the scene, don't just list keywords."**

Narrative, descriptive paragraphs produce better images than disconnected keyword lists.

## Prompting Strategies

### Photorealistic Scenes
Use photography terminology: camera angles, lens types, lighting details, textures.

### Stylized Illustrations & Stickers
Be explicit about style. Specify background treatment (transparent or colored).

### Text in Images
Be clear about text content and describe font style in words (not font names).

### Product Mockups
Include studio lighting descriptions, camera angles, and focus points.

## Example Prompts

### Photorealistic Portrait
> "A photorealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with deep, sun-etched wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile. He is carefully inspecting a freshly glazed tea bowl..."

### Stylized Sticker
> "A kawaii-style sticker of a happy red panda wearing a tiny bamboo hat. It's munching on a green bamboo leaf..."

### Logo with Text
> "Create a modern, minimalist logo for a coffee shop called 'The Daily Grind'. The text should be in a clean, bold, sans-serif font..."

### Product Photography
> "A high-resolution, studio-lit product photograph of a minimalist ceramic coffee mug in matte black, presented on a polished concrete surface..."
