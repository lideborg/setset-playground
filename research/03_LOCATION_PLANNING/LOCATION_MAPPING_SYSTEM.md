# Location Mapping System: Similar But Different

**Purpose:** Ensure all three models (Ava, Luna, Noah) have comparable locations with unique variations

---

## The Strategy

**Same Location Category + Different Specifics**

This allows you to:
- Compare how each model performs in similar contexts
- Maintain variety so prompts don't feel identical
- Create a cohesive portfolio per model

## 20-Prompt Location Map

### STUDIO SECTION (1-4): Identical Structure

All three models get the same studio setup variations:

| # | Location | Variation | All Models |
|---|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | White seamless background | Hard directional light | Same |
| 2 | Concrete floor | Rembrandt lighting | Same |
| 3 | Gradient backdrop | Side lighting headshot | Same |
| 4 | White seamless | Rim backlight | Same |

**Why:** Studio creates baseline for comparing models in controlled environment

### ENVIRONMENTAL SECTION (5-20): Similar Categories, Different Specifics

#### Prompts 5-8: BRIGHT EPIC (f/16 landscapes)

**Category:** Industrial/Institutional/Dramatic vast spaces with harsh light

| # | Ava Martinez | Luna Park | Noah Chen |

| 5 | Natural history museum grand interior | Modern art gallery white walls | Concrete basin industrial |
| 6 | Salt flats white horizon | White jetty coastal minimal | Asphalt lot industrial |
| 7 | Canyon overlook dramatic vista | Quarry white stone walls | Concrete channel minimal |
| 8 | Marble quarry stone walls | Desert salt pan expansive | Concrete slab geometric |

**Common Thread:** Harsh overhead sun, epic scale, 35mm f/16
**Variation:** Different textures (museum vs jetty vs basin)

---

#### Prompts 9-11: GOLDEN/WARM LIGHT (f/11 dramatic)

**Category:** Observation points and glass structures with warm atmospheric light

| # | Ava Martinez | Luna Park | Noah Chen |

| 9 | Observatory platform twilight | Observation deck sunset | White minimal roof twilight |
| 10 | Heath landscape golden hour | Open heath sunset glow | Gorse landscape golden hour |
| 11 | Botanical conservatory glass | Glass conservatory botanical | White enclosure golden glow |

**Common Thread:** Warm light (twilight/golden hour), atmospheric
**Variation:** Different architectural elements (platform vs deck vs roof)

---

**Common Thread:** Special memorable locations
**Variation:** Different luxury contexts (pool vs meadow vs space)

---

## Variation Rules

### Rule 1: Category Consistency
Within each group (5-8, 9-11, 12-15, 16-18, 19-20), all three models should be in the **same type of environment**:

- Prompts 5-8: All industrial/institutional/dramatic
- Prompts 9-11: All golden hour observation points
- Prompts 12-15: All soft nature settings
- Prompts 16-18: All geometric architecture
- Prompts 19-20: All luxury unique

### Rule 2: Lighting Consistency
All three models in the same prompt number should have the **same lighting approach**:

- Prompt 5: All "bright museum/gallery lighting even illumination"
- Prompt 6: All "bright harsh overhead sunlight"
- Prompt 7: All "bright natural light creating definition"
- Prompt 9: All "soft twilight natural light"
- Prompt 10: All "golden hour natural light warm glow"

### Rule 3: Camera Spec Consistency
All three models in the same prompt number should use the **same lens/aperture**:

- Prompts 5-8: All 35mm f/16
- Prompts 9-20: All 35mm f/11
- Prompt 3 only: All 85mm f/5.6

### Rule 4: Pose Variation (Where Different)
Can vary poses slightly within same prompt number:

- Prompt 6: Ava walks, Luna walks, Noah walks (same)
- Prompt 17: Ava walks, Luna walks, Noah walks (same)
- Others: Mix of standing variations

---

## Why This Works

### Comparability
You can line up the three models side-by-side:
```
Prompt #5:
- Ava: Museum interior
- Luna: Gallery interior
- Noah: Basin industrial

All share: Bright epic, f/16, institutional scale
Different: Specific location details
```

### Variety
Each model gets unique locations, not carbon copies:
```
Prompt #12:
- Ava: Bamboo forest
- Luna: Pine forest
- Noah: Hay field

All share: Soft natural, serene, f/11
Different: Natural element type
```

### Portfolio Cohesion
Each model maintains their own aesthetic while being comparable:
- Ava: Softer natural elements (bamboo, meadow, zen garden)
- Luna: Balanced mix (pine, reflecting pool, coastal)
- Noah: Industrial edge (basin, channel, slab)

---

## Implementation Example

### Prompt #6 (All Three Models)

**Category:** BRIGHT EPIC - Vast minimal landscapes with harsh sun
**Lighting:** "bright harsh overhead sunlight creating defined shadows"
**Camera:** 35mm f/16
**Pose:** Walking (creates motion in vast space)
**Energy:** "confident powerful gaze forward motion purposeful selling"

**Ava Martinez:**
```
Editorial environmental salt flats, this woman with honey blonde wavy bob and
light medium complexion, full body head to toe feet visible in frame centered
walking salt flats minimal white horizon dramatic, bright harsh overhead sunlight
creating defined shadows all sharp focus f/16 entire landscape...
```

**Luna Park:**
```
Editorial environmental jetty, this woman with long black straight hair and light
medium complexion, full body head to toe feet visible in frame centered walking
white jetty minimal huge sky background expansive 80 percent sky, bright harsh
overhead sunlight creating defined shadows all sharp focus f/16 entire landscape...
```

**Noah Chen:**
```
Editorial environmental lot, this man with blonde wavy bob and fair light complexion,
full body head to toe feet visible in frame centered walking asphalt lot minimal
huge sky background 80 percent sky, bright harsh overhead sunlight creating defined
shadows all sharp focus f/16 entire landscape...
```

**What's Same:**
- Walking pose
- Bright harsh overhead sunlight
- 35mm f/16
- Huge sky 80 percent
- Motion purposeful energy

**What's Different:**
- Salt flats vs Jetty vs Asphalt lot
- White horizon vs coastal vs industrial
- Specific subject descriptions (hair, skin, etc.)

| **Specific Location** | ❌ | ✅ Yes (museum vs gallery vs basin) |
| **Lighting Type** | ✅ Yes (e.g., all "golden hour" for #10) | ❌ |
| **Camera Specs** | ✅ Yes (all 35mm f/16 for #5-8) | ❌ |
| **Pose** | ✅ Mostly (walking in #6, #17) | Sometimes varied |

## Benefits of This System

1. **Easy Comparison:** Line up three models at same prompt # to compare
2. **Portfolio Diversity:** Each model has unique locations
3. **Category Cohesion:** Organized by lighting/mood groups
4. **Systematic Variation:** Know exactly what changes and what stays same
5. **Scalability:** Can add more models using same system

---

## How to Use This for Future Models

When creating prompts for Model #13 (new model):

1. **Copy the structure** from Ava/Luna/Noah
2. **Keep:** Categories, lighting types, camera specs, pose patterns
3. **Change:** Specific locations within each category
4. **Example for Prompt #5:**
   - Ava: Museum
   - Luna: Gallery
   - Noah: Basin
   - **Model #13:** Convention center / Library / Train station (institutional with epic scale)

This ensures all models are comparable while maintaining uniqueness.
