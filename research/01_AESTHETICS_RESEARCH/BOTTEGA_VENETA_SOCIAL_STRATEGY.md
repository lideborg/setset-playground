# Bottega Veneta Social Media Strategy Research

## Executive Summary

Bottega Veneta's radical 2021 decision to delete all social media (2.5M Instagram followers) and pivot to a digital journal strategy represents one of the most bold anti-marketing moves in luxury fashion. The strategy prioritizes exclusivity, editorial depth, and "stealth luxury" over constant engagement—and has resulted in 70% higher popularity than competitors despite zero Instagram presence.

---

## 1. The Digital Journal Approach: "Issue"

### Launch & Format
- **Launch Date:** March 2021 (2 months after deleting Instagram)
- **Format:** Quarterly digital magazine published at bottegaveneta.com
- **First Edition:** 133 pages of brand imagery, videos, and editorial content
- **Publishing Schedule:** Aligned with new collection arrivals in boutiques

### Content Strategy
Issue functions as a curated, permanent archive rather than ephemeral social content:

**Content Types:**
- Photography (editorial spreads, not product shots)
- Films and video content
- Collages and CGI videos
- Design sketches
- Archive documentation
- Collaborations with artists, photographers, musicians

**Notable Collaborators (Issue 01):**
- Barbara Hulanicki (designer)
- Missy Elliott (musician)
- Tyrone Lebon (photographer)

### Philosophy Behind the Journal

**Creative Director Daniel Lee's Reasoning:**
- "Social media oversimplifies my work and represents the homogenization of culture"
- "There is a mood of playground bullying on social media which I don't really like. I wanted to do something joyful instead"
- Desire for "more progressive and thoughtful" space for creativity

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Permanence:** Content doesn't disappear after 24 hours like Stories
- **Scale:** Artists' and photographers' work displayed in larger, flattering format vs. mobile phone screen
- **Control:** Full creative control over presentation and narrative
- **Intentionality:** Every piece of content is curated, not reactive

## 2. Creating Exclusivity Without Traditional Social Media

### The "No-Marketing Marketing" Strategy

**Kering's Explanation:**
"Bottega has decided, in line with its positioning, to lean much more on its ambassadors and fans by giving them the material they need to talk about the brand through various social networks, by letting them speak for the brand rather than doing it itself."

### Alternative Marketing Channels

**1. Ambassador & Celebrity-Driven Content**
- Strategic partnerships with high-profile personalities who post brand content on their own channels
- First-ever brand ambassador: BTS's RM (announced Q2 2023)
- Campaign stars: A$AP Rocky, Kendall Jenner, Jacob Elordi, Shu Qi
- **Effect:** Leverages celebrities' credibility and reach without managing own accounts

**2. Organic Fan Accounts**
- Unofficial accounts like @newbottega become "organic PR machines"
- Fans share photos, news, and create moodboards
- These accounts signal a new luxury consumer: values craftsmanship over clout
- **Strategy:** Let passionate consumers be the storytellers

**3. Controlled Owned Media**
- Issue digital journal (quarterly)
- Email newsletters
- Website content
- Physical lookbooks presented in book form

**4. Regional Platform Strategy**
- Maintained presence on WeChat (APAC markets)
- Returned to Weibo (Chinese social network) in 2023 for FW23 collection teasers
- Strategic, surgical engagement rather than scattershot posting

**5. Experiential Marketing**
- Exclusive events (not documented on social media)
- Fashion show invitations designed as collectible art pieces
- "Fashion show invites aren't just a slip of paper people will chuck away. They're pieces of fashion history, likely to be posted all over social media and documented in archives for decades."

### The Scarcity Principle in Action

**"Stealth Wealth" Branding:**
- No-logo approach as core marketing pillar
- Previous tagline: "When your own initials are enough"
- Anti-trend, anti-overexposure positioning
- By not chasing daily engagement, every brand appearance feels intentional and rare

**Results:**
- 70% higher popularity rate than competitors (per @databutmakeitfashion)
- #6 in Lyst Index Q4 2024 (ahead of Gucci #12, Versace #14, Balenciaga #15)
- Maintained and increased brand heat under both Daniel Lee and Matthieu Blazy

## 3. Instagram Carousel Strategy (Pre-Deletion)

### Launch Partnership with Instagram (2018)
Bottega Veneta was a **launch partner for Instagram's carousel ads in Stories format**

**Campaign:** "Reflections" Spring 2018
- Creative Director: Tomas Maier
- Agency: Baron & Baron
- **CMO Lisa Pomerantz:** "Instagram Stories has provided yet another expressive tool for brands to share their stories. And now, the new Instagram Stories carousel ad product allows us to tell a multifaceted story in a place where the audience who loves luxury fashion instinctively goes."

### Carousel Ad Strategy

**Sequential Ad Experience (via SocialCode):**

**Phase 1: Brand Awareness**
- Visually evocative storytelling video ads in Instagram feed
- Focus on emotion and narrative, not product

**Phase 2: Traffic Generation**
- Gender-specific photo ads in carousel format
- Featured bags and accessories
- Each carousel photo had "Shop Now" CTA linking to website
- Targeted to value-based lookalike audiences in US, Japan, South Korea

**Why Carousels Worked:**
- Allowed "multifaceted storytelling" in native format
- Combined editorial photography with shoppable functionality
- Maintained luxury aesthetic while driving commerce

## 4. Editorial vs. Commercial: Key Differentiators

### Editorial Content Characteristics

**Visual Language:**
- Highly polished, professional imagery that could appear in glossy fashion magazines
- Timeless aesthetic vs. trendy or momentary
- Photography-first, not product-first
- Narrative and emotion over features and benefits
- Motion and movement (campaign videos, fashion shows, editorial shoots)

**Content Structure:**
- Each post feels part of a larger narrative
- Carefully themed digital campaigns
- Cohesive feed aesthetic
- Curated collaborations with artists and creators

**Messaging Approach:**
- Focus on brand story, heritage, design philosophy
- No text-heavy captions or commercial messaging
- "Simply appreciate the ingenuity and aesthetics of photos"
- Minimal product descriptions

**Format Strategy:**
- Feed = Editorial, timeless, permanent
- Stories = Commercial, ephemeral, product-focused
- Separation of church and state between brand building and selling

### Commercial Content Mistakes to Avoid

**What Damages Engagement:**
- Static product shots
- Inappropriate use of text over images
- Inclusion of commercial messages with image content
- Trendy, momentary content in feed
- Overselling or promotional tone

### The Bottega Approach to Editorial

**Before Deletion:**
- Launch partner for innovative Instagram features (carousels in Stories)
- Sequential storytelling: awareness (video) → consideration (carousel) → conversion (website)
- Gender-specific creative for relevance
- Value-based lookalike targeting for quality audience

**After Deletion:**
- Physical lookbooks in book form (SS21)
- 133-page digital journal with photography, films, CGI, sketches, archives
- Quarterly publishing schedule (not daily posting)
- Collaborations with artists across disciplines
- Permanent, large-format presentation

## 5. Campaign Reveal Structure

### The Matthieu Blazy Era (2023-Present)

**Fashion Show Invitations as First Touchpoint:**
- "Matthieu Blazy knows Bottega's marketing doesn't start when the show begins"
- Invitations designed as collectible art pieces around collection themes
- Invitations posted across social media by recipients
- Creates anticipation and documentation without brand's own accounts

**Multi-Channel Reveal Strategy:**

**1. Teaser Phase**
- Platform-specific teasers (e.g., Weibo for FW23)
- Selective, surgical content drops
- Build mystery and anticipation

**2. Celebrity/Ambassador Rollout**
- Campaign stars post brand visuals on their channels
- Leverages their reach and credibility
- Creates organic buzz across multiple audiences

**3. Digital Journal Feature**
- Quarterly Issue publication with campaign photography
- Long-form editorial content
- Behind-the-scenes: sketches, process, collaborations
- Permanent archive on brand website

**4. Owned Media Ecosystem**
- Email to subscribers
- Website homepage takeover
- Press releases to fashion media

**5. Organic Amplification**
- Fan accounts (@newbottega and similar) share and curate
- Fashion press coverage
- Consumer-generated content

### The Anti-Announcement Strategy

**Key Principle:** Never announce the announcement
- No "coming soon" posts
- No countdown timers
- Sudden, unexpected appearances
- Creates FOMO and discovery moments
- "By not chasing daily engagement, the brand made every appearance feel more intentional and rare"

## The Bottom Line

Bottega Veneta's strategy proves that in luxury (and by extension, premium creative tools), **less is more**. By rejecting the attention economy and embracing intentional scarcity, they've created more desire and achieved higher brand heat than competitors posting daily.

For a fashion AI tool account:
- **Don't try to compete on volume**
- **Compete on quality and curation**
- **Build a journal/archive, not just a feed**
- **Let the work and the community speak**
- **Make every post feel like an event, not content**

The goal isn't engagement metrics—it's creating work so compelling that others can't help but share it.
