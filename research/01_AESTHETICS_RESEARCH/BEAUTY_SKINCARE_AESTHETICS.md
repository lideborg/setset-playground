## TECHNICAL PHOTOGRAPHY GUIDELINES

### Macro Beauty Photography Essentials

#### Lens Selection
- **100mm macro**: Standard close-up work, requires very close proximity
- **180mm macro**: Preferred for extreme close-ups (eyes, lips), comfortable working distance
- **Avoid under 70mm**: Distorts facial features at close range

#### Camera Settings for Skin
- **Aperture**: f/16 and up for macro work to maintain sharpness across face
- **ISO**: Low (100-400) for minimal grain on skin texture
- **Shutter speed**: Adequate for sharp focus, use studio strobes to freeze motion
- **White balance**: Custom set for accurate skin tone rendering

#### Lighting for Different Skin Finishes

**DEWY SKIN (Glossier style)**
- Soft, diffused natural window light
- Large softbox for even, flat illumination
- Fill light to eliminate shadows
- Slight forward angle to catch natural sheen

**GLOWY SKIN (Charlotte Tilbury style)**
- Multiple light sources from different angles
- Beauty dish for main light with catchlights
- Reflectors to bounce light onto highlight points
- Backlight for rim glow effect

**AUTHENTIC SKIN (Fenty Beauty style)**
- Direct but controlled lighting
- Ring light for even coverage across diverse skin tones
- Color gels for creative effects
- Ensure proper exposure for deep skin tones (meter for shadows)

**LUMINOUS SKIN (La Mer style)**
- Soft overhead light mimicking spa atmosphere
- Subtle blue gels mixed with warm key light
- Diffusion for ethereal quality
- Catch lights in eyes for life and vitality

**NATURAL SKIN (Aesop style)**
- Honest natural light from windows
- Minimal artificial manipulation
- Side lighting acceptable as focus is often product
- Texture-revealing rather than texture-hiding

#### Composition Techniques

**Close-up Framing**
- **Extreme close-up**: Lips only, eye only, skin detail (Glossier, macro product shots)
- **Tight crop**: Forehead to chin, emphasizing facial features (most beauty brands)
- **Classic beauty**: Head and shoulders, showing neck and décolletage (Charlotte Tilbury, La Mer)

**Angles for Skin**
- **Slight head tilt back**: Allows light to illuminate features, ideal for lip/eye close-ups
- **Three-quarter angle**: Flattering for cheekbone structure (Charlotte Tilbury)
- **Straight-on**: Intimate, direct connection (Glossier, Fenty)
- **Slight camera angle shifts**: Can smooth or reveal texture depending on need

**Avoiding Common Mistakes**
- **Side lighting**: Emphasizes uneven texture, avoid unless intentional
- **Too shallow depth of field**: Parts of face out of focus in macro work
- **Harsh shadows**: Unflattering on skin, double-diffuse your light sources
- **Wrong skin tone metering**: Meter for midtones, not highlights or shadows
- **Over-retouching**: Modern aesthetic celebrates some natural texture
